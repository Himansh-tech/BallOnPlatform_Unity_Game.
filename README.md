# Ball on Platform - Unity Game

This is a Unity game I created while learning from **Unity Learn**. The game features a ball navigating a platform while avoiding obstacles and using power-ups.

## 🎮 Gameplay Video & Code
I have uploaded the **gameplay video** and **code** here. Due to GitHub's video size limit, I couldn't upload all scene settings.

## 🕹️ Controls
- **W & S** → Apply force to move the ball **forward and backward**.
- **A & D** → Change the **camera direction**. The ball moves in the forward direction of the camera, adding difficulty and unpredictability.

## 🎯 Game Objective
- Control the **multicolored ball** and avoid **blue balls** that try to push you off the platform.
- Use **Power-ups** to push enemy balls away with great force for a **limited time**.
