# BallOnPlatform_Unity_Game.
Here I have uploaded Codes and Gameplay video Ball on plartform game which I made while learning Unity from Unity learn. Can't upload all scene settings because github video size limt. But here is the explnation.

=> Use "w" and "s" to apply force and thereby move ball forward and backward
=> use "A" and "D" to change direction of camera and remember it will go ahead int the forward direction of camera which actually make it hard to control the ball add unpredectibility.
=> You have to save your multicoloe ball from blue balls which are trying to push you down from the platform.
=> You can also use Powerups to push balls away with great force for some specific time.
=> Below is the link of the game. Have Fun!!
